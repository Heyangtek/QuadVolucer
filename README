QuadVolucer

QuadVolucer is a Quadcopter project basend on the STM32 Microcontroller. It uses a ITG-3200 3-axis gyroskope.

The aim of this project is not to develop a Copter which is as stable as can be but to leave control to the pilot. Therefore controll is HH only.
To archive this no ACCs are needed. There is a footprint for a 3-axis ACC on the PCB though. So angular control could be implemented but I'm propably not going to do so.
